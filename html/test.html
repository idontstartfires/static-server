        <p>Sass is used for styling. Sass is setup to watch for changes to files in the styles/scss folder. 
        It then compiles the scss to css in the styles/css folder. The server watches for changes in the 
        styles/css folder, so it can determine which files sass compiled. These file names are communicated
        to the client via sever-sent events. Javascript then reloads that corresponding stylesheet</p>
